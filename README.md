# Lyrics-Folder-Generator
This python script takes the lyrics of a file and makes them into a sequence of folders. Yeah, pretty useful if you ask me.

# Usage
To use you have to write the lyrics of the song in lyrics.txt and it will generate a folder for every line of the lyrics.txt file.
Oh yeah, important, do NOT put blank lines onto lyrics.txt or else the script will stop creating folders.

# Requisites
Python

# Execution
To execute please execute exec.cmd I don´t know why it won´t work if you try to execute directly.
